Always position the hoist lift arms as shown in the illustration. Do not use the engine to power the drive wheels unless all drive wheels are elevated off the ground. Incorrect hoist arm positioning or drive wheels in contact with the ground can cause unintended vehicle movement. Failure to follow these instructions may result in serious personal injury or death.

Identify the correct jacking points as shown in the illustration. Position the vehicle on a hard, level surface. After jacking, always support vehicle with jack stands. Never get under a vehicle supported only by a jack. Set the parking brake and block all wheels remaining on the ground. Failure to follow these instructions may result in unintended vehicle movement and serious personal injury or death.

The high-voltage system utilizes approximately 300 volts DC, provided through high-voltage cables to its components and modules. The high-voltage cables and wiring are identified by orange harness tape or orange wire covering. All high-voltage components are marked with high-voltage warning labels with a high-voltage symbol. Failure to follow these instructions may result in serious personal injury or death.
