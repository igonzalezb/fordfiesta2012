</span>-equipped vehicles) (located behind the rear bumper
cover)
</li></ul><p><b>Manual Door Lock
</b></p><p>In the event of a failure of the power door locks, the doors can be individually locked through the manual door lock. The manual door lock is located on the rear edge of the door just above the door latch opening. For the doors on the driver
side of the vehicle, insert a key and turn the key clockwise to lock. For the doors on the passenger side of the vehicle, insert a key and turn the key counterclockwise to lock.
</p><p><b>Power Lock/Unlock

</p><p><b>Smart Unlock
</b></p><p><b>Without Intelligent Access (IA)
</b></p><p>The smart unlock feature prevents the doors from locking with the key in the ignition lock cylinder. When the vehicle is locked from the central lock control switch and the key is in the ignition lock cylinder with one of the front doors
open, the doors lock and then unlock.
</p><p>The vehicle can still be locked with the key in the ignition lock cylinder by locking the doors with another key in the driver door lock cylinder.
</p><p><b>With Intelligent Access (IA)
</b></p><p>The smart unlock feature prevents the doors from electronically locking when an 
<span title="Intelligent Access" class="popup" onmouseover="this.className='popupnounderline';" onmouseout="this.className='popup';">IA
</span> key is left inside the vehicle. When a door becomes ajar, the interior of the vehicle is
scanned for an 
<span title="Intelligent Access" class="popup" onmouseover="this.className='popupnounderline';" onmouseout="this.className='popup';">IA
</span> key. If an 
<span title="Intelligent Access" class="popup" onmouseover="this.className='popupnounderline';" onmouseout="this.className='popup';">IA
</span> key is inside the vehicle when a door is ajar and a lock command is
received the doors lock and then unlock.
</p><p>The vehicle can still be locked with an 
<span title="Intelligent Access" class="popup" onmouseover="this.className='popupnounderline';" onmouseout="this.className='popup';">IA
</span> key inside the vehicle by locking the doors with another key in the driver door lock cylinder or the lock button pressed on
another key.
</p><p><b>Luggage Compartment/Liftgate Smart Unlock Feature — Intelligent Access (IA)
</b></p><p>The luggage compartment/liftgate smart unlock feature prevents the luggage compartment/liftgate from latching when an 
<span title="Intelligent Access" class="popup" onmouseover="this.className='popupnounderline';" onmouseout="this.className='popup';">IA
</span> key is detected inside the luggage compartment
area. When the luggage compartment lid/liftgate is closed when the doors are locked, the luggage compartment is searched for an 
<span title="Intelligent Access" class="popup" onmouseover="this.className='popupnounderline';" onmouseout="this.className='popup';">IA
</span> key. If an

<span title="Intelligent Access" class="popup" onmouseover="this.className='popupnounderline';" onmouseout="this.className='popup';">IA

</p><p>An 
<span title="Intelligent Access" class="popup" onmouseover="this.className='popupnounderline';" onmouseout="this.className='popup';">IA
</span> key can still be locked inside a luggage compartment/ liftgate area by closing the luggage compartment lid/liftgate when the doors are unlocked and then locking
the doors after the luggage compartment lid/ liftgate is closed with the key inside. Or if a second 
<span title="Intelligent Access" class="popup" onmouseover="this.className='popupnounderline';" onmouseout="this.className='popup';">IA
</span> key is in range of the luggage compartment/
liftgate
