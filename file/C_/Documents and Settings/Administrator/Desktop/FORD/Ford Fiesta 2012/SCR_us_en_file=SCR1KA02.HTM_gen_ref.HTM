<ul type="square"><li>Retractors
</li><li>Buckles
</li><li>Child safety seat tether bracket assemblies
</li><li>Automatic locking retractor (ALR) feature for child safety seats (passenger seating positions only)
</li><li>Belt tension sensor (BTS) (if equipped)
</li><li>Front safety belt buckle support assemblies (slide bar) (if equipped)
</li><li>Safety belt shoulder belt height adjusters (if equipped)
</li></ul>Components that do not operate correctly or pass all Functional Tests in the Component Tests of this section must be replaced with new components.

<br><br>Safety belt assembly attaching areas must be inspected. Damaged or distorted attaching areas must be restored to their original structural integrity and a new safety belt assembly with new attaching hardware must be installed.

<br><br>After deployment of the front safety belt pretensioners, a new safety belt system (including retractors, buckles and height adjusters) must be installed.

<br><br>Failure to follow this instruction may result in incorrect operation of the safety belt system and increases the risk of serious personal injury or death in a crash.
</b></p><p>Use only the replacement parts specified in the Ford Catalog Advantageâ„¢ or equivalent when installing new safety belt buckles and/or retractor assemblies.

<p><b>Safety Belt Retractors
</b></p><p>The safety belt retractors consist of the following components:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>Safety belt retractor pretensioner (front only), on vehicles equipped with 
<span title="Supplemental Restraint System" class="popup" onmouseover="this.className='popupnounderline';" onmouseout="this.className='popup';">SRS
</span></li><li>Adaptive load limiting (front passenger only), on vehicles equipped with 
<span title="Supplemental Restraint System" class="popup" onmouseover="this.className='popupnounderline';" onmouseout="this.className='popup';">SRS
</span></li><li>Dual locking mode

<ul type="square"><li>Emergency Locking Retractor (ELR)
</li><li>Automatic Locking Retractor (ALR) (all except driver seat)
</li></ul></li><li>Belt Tension Sensor (BTS) (front passenger only), on vehicles equipped with 
<span title="Supplemental Restraint System" class="popup" onmouseover="this.className='popupnounderline';" onmouseout="this.className='popup';">SRS
</span></li></ul><p><b>Automatic Locking Retractor (ALR)
</b></p><p>The 
<span title="Automatic Locking Retractor" class="popup" onmouseover="this.className='popupnounderline';" onmouseout="this.className='popup';">ALR
</span> mode is used when locking a child seat in any passenger seating position.
The 
<span title="Automatic Locking Retractor" class="popup" onmouseover="this.className='popupnounderline';" onmouseout="this.className='popup';">ALR
</span> mode automatically activates when the safety belt webbing is fully extracted from the retractor and then allowed to retract. As the safety belt webbing retracts
back onto the spool, an audible clicking sound is made indicating the safety belt retractor is in 
<span title="Automatic Locking Retractor" class="popup" onmouseover="this.className='popupnounderline';" onmouseout="this.className='popup';">ALR
</span> mode and the safety belt webbing will not pull back out of the
safety belt retractor. The 
<span title="Automatic Locking Retractor" class="popup" onmouseover="this.className='popupnounderline';" onmouseout="this.className='popup';">ALR
</span> mode disengages when the webbing is allowed to fully retract back into the retractor. For testing, refer to the appropriate Functional
Test procedure in 
<a href="SCR_us_en_file%3dSCR1KA03.HTM_gen_ref.HTM"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       >Safety Belt System
</a> in this section.
</p><p><b>Safety Belt Retractor Pretensioner
</b></p><p>The safety belt retractor pretensioner is a pyrotechnic device that removes excess webbing from the safety belt system when deployed by the 
<span title="Supplemental Restraint System" class="popup" onmouseover="this.className='popupnounderline';" onmouseout="this.className='popup';">SRS
</span>. When the
pretensioner deploys, the retractor spools in the safety belt webbing, removing excess webbing from the lap and shoulder safety belts.
</p><p>If the vehicle is involved in a crash resulting in pretensioner deployment, install a new safety belt retractor pretensioner. For safety belt retractor pretensioner diagnosis and disposal information, refer
to 
<a target="_parent" href="SCR_us_en_leftside%3dSCRS1KBL.HTM%26rightside%3dSCRS1KBR.HTM%26market%3dus%26lang%3den_gen_2col.htm"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               >Section 501-20B
</a>.
</p><p>If the ignition is ON with the safety belt retractor pretensioner electrical connector(s) disconnected, a DTC sets.
</p><p>The pretensioner feature is only available on the front safety belt retractors of 
<span title="Supplemental Restraint System" class="popup" onmouseover="this.className='popupnounderline';" onmouseout="this.className='popup';">SRS
</span>-equipped vehicles.
</p><p><b>Adaptive Load Limiting
</b></p><p>Adaptive load limiting safety belt retractors are pyrotechnic devices integrated with the front passenger safety belt retractor assembly. The adaptive load limiting safety belt retractor works in conjunction with the safety belt pretensioner to
control the tension of the front passenger safety belt. The Restraints Control Module (RCM) monitors the readiness of the adaptive load limiting safety belt retractor. The

<span title="Restraints Control Module" class="popup" onmouseover="this.className='popupnounderline';" onmouseout="this.className='popup';">RCM
</span> uses this information and all other information provided by the restraints system to determine what action is to be taken.
</p><p>The adaptive load limiting pyrotechnic device feature is only available on the front passenger safety belt retractors of 
<span title="Supplemental Restraint System" class="popup" onmouseover="this.className='popupnounderline';" onmouseout="this.className='popup';">SRS
</span>-equipped vehicles.
</p><p><b>Emergency Locking Retractor (ELR)
</b></p><p>The 
<span title="Emergency Locking Retractor" class="popup" onmouseover="this.className='popupnounderline';" onmouseout="this.className='popup';">ELR
</span> is a vehicle-sensitive feature designed to activate and lock the safety belt webbing during hard braking, cornering hard or in an impact of approximately
24 km/h (15 mph). The 
<span title="Emergency Locking Retractor" class="popup" onmouseover="this.className='popupnounderline';" onmouseout="this.className='popup';">ELR
</span> feature helps reduce the forward movement of the driver and passengers. For testing, refer to the appropriate Functional Test procedure in

<a href="SCR_us_en_file%3dSCR1KA03.HTM_gen_ref.HTM"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       >Safety Belt System

</b></p><p>The 
<span title="Belt Tension Sensor" class="popup" onmouseover="this.className='popupnounderline';" onmouseout="this.className='popup';">BTS
</span> is located at the front passenger safety belt retractor anchor point and operates as part of the
Occupant Classification System (OCS) system on the front passenger seat. To diagnose the

</p><p><b>Rear Safety Belt Buckles
</b></p><p>The rear seat safety belt buckles are attached to the floor pan under the rear seat cushion. The LH safety belt buckle is part of the rear center safety belt retractor and is serviced as an assembly. The rear dual safety belt buckle
assembly (RH and center buckle) is also serviced as an assembly.

not serviced separately from the seat back.
</li><li>Non-serviceable Lower Anchors and Tethers for CHildren (LATCH), welded to the floor pan.
</li></ul><p>If a child safety seat was in use during a collision, inspect the vehicle structure at the child safety seat component mounting areas, repair any damage and restore the vehicle to the original production configuration.
