<ul type="square"><li>Retractors
</li><li>Buckles
</li><li>Child safety seat tether bracket assemblies
</li><li>Automatic locking retractor (ALR) feature for child safety seats (passenger seating positions only)
</li><li>Belt tension sensor (BTS) (if equipped)
</li><li>Front safety belt buckle support assemblies (slide bar) (if equipped)
</li><li>Safety belt shoulder belt height adjusters (if equipped)
</li></ul>Components that do not operate correctly or pass all Functional Tests in the Component Tests of this section must be replaced with new components.

<br><br>Safety belt assembly attaching areas must be inspected. Damaged or distorted attaching areas must be restored to their original structural integrity and a new safety belt assembly with new attaching hardware must be installed.

<br><br>After deployment of the front safety belt pretensioners, a new safety belt system (including retractors, buckles and height adjusters) must be installed.

<br><br>Failure to follow this instruction may result in incorrect operation of the safety belt system and increases the risk of serious personal injury or death in a crash.

<p><b>Safety Belt Warning System
</b></p><p>The safety belt warning system is present only on vehicles equipped with a Supplemental Restraint System (SRS). The conditions of operation for the safety belt warning indicator and chime are
as follows:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>If the driver safety belt is not buckled when the ignition is ON, the safety belt warning indicator illuminates for 1 to 2 minutes and the warning chime sounds for 4 to 8 seconds.
</li><li>If the driver safety belt is buckled while the warning indicator is illuminated and the chime is sounding, the warning indicator and warning chime turn OFF.
</li><li>If the driver safety belt is buckled before the ignition is turned ON, the warning indicator and chime remain off.
</li></ul><div><a name="extract_122">&nbsp;
</a></div>

<p><b>Belt-Minder®
</b></p><p>The Belt-Minder® feature is present only on vehicles equipped with an 
<span title="Supplemental Restraint System" class="popup" onmouseover="this.className='popupnounderline';" onmouseout="this.className='popup';">SRS
</span> and is a supplemental warning to the safety belt warning function. This feature
provides additional reminders that the driver and/or front passenger safety belt is unbuckled by intermittently sounding a chime and illuminating the safety belt warning indicator in the
Instrument Panel Cluster (IPC).
</p><p>Either the driver or front passenger safety belt systems may activate the Belt-Minder®. If the Belt-Minder® warnings have expired (warnings last for approximately 5 minutes) for one occupant (driver or front passenger), the other
occupant can still activate the Belt-Minder® feature.
</p><p>The passenger Belt-Minder® feature is activated only when the Occupant Classification System (OCS) system detects a passenger in the right front seat and the passenger weight exceeds
a programmed limit. For information on the 
<span title="Occupant Classification System" class="popup" onmouseover="this.className='popupnounderline';" onmouseout="this.className='popup';">OCS
</span> system, refer to
