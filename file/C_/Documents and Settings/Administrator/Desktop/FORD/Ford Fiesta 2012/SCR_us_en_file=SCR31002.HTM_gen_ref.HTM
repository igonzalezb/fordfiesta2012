<p>The 1.6L 4-cylinder engine has the following features:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>Dual overhead camshaft
</li><li>Four valves per cylinder
</li><li>Sequential Multi-Port Fuel Injection (SFI)
</li><li>Aluminum cylinder head
</li><li>Aluminum cylinder block
</li><li>Twin independent Variable Camshaft Timing (VCT) system
</li><li></li></ul><p>The 1.6L engine is a 4 valve-per-cylinder, dual overhead camshaft engine. The engine uses an ignition coil and spark plug wires. The cylinder block is made of aluminum and the bearing caps are integrated into the ladder assembly. An aluminum
oil pan bolts to the bottom of the lower cylinder block and to the transmission to provide greater strength. The camshafts are mounted in the cylinder head and act against valve tappets to open and close the valves. The camshafts are driven off the
front of the cylinder head by one timing belt. The belt is driven by a sprocket that is located on the crankshaft. The piston assembly is an aluminum piston with a sinter forged carbon steel connecting rod. The oil pump is driven by the crankshaft.

<p><b>Engine Identification
</b></p><p>Always refer to these labels when installation of new parts is necessary or when checking engine calibrations. The engine parts often differ within a CID family. Verification of the identification codes will make sure the correct parts are
obtained. These codes contain all the pertinent information relating to the dates, optional equipment and revisions.

<p><b>Exhaust Emission Control System
</b></p><p>Operation and necessary maintenance of the exhaust emission control devices used on this engine are covered in the Powertrain Control/Emissions Diagnosis (PC/ED) manual.

<p><b>Induction System
</b></p><p>The 
<span title="Sequential Multi-Port Fuel Injection" class="popup" onmouseover="this.className='popupnounderline';" onmouseout="this.className='popup';">SFI
</span> provides the fuel/air mixture needed for combustion in the cylinders. The 4 solenoid-operated fuel injectors:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>are mounted in the cylinder head.
</li><li>meter fuel into the air intake stream in accordance with engine demand.
</li><li>are positioned so that their tips direct fuel just ahead of the engine intake valves.
</li><li>supply fuel from the fuel tank with a fuel pump mounted in the fuel tank.
</li></ul><div><a name="extract_201">&nbsp;

<p><b>Twin Independent Variable Camshaft Timing (VCT) System
</b></p><p>The twin independent 
<span title="Variable Camshaft Timing" class="popup" onmouseover="this.className='popupnounderline';" onmouseout="this.className='popup';">VCT
</span> system allows variable control of intake valve closing which optimizes combustion at full load providing improved power and low speed
torque (broadening the torque curve) which enables variable valve overlap which provides better fuel economy and emissions and provides optimized cold start operation with improved exhaust emissions.
</p><div><a name="extract_202">&nbsp;
</a></div>

<p><b>PCV System
</b></p><p>All engines are equipped with a closed-type PCV system recycling the crankcase vapors to the intake manifold.
</p><div><a name="extract_203">&nbsp;
</a></div>

<p><b>Lubrication System
</b></p><p>The engine lubrication system operates as follows:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>Oil is drawn into the oil pump through the oil pump screen cover and tube in the sump of the oil pan.
</li><li>Oil is pumped through the oil filter on the left front side of the cylinder block and is cooled by an oil cooler.
</li><li>Oil enters the main gallery where it is distributed to the crankshaft main journals and to the cylinder head.
</li><li>From the main journals, the oil is routed through cross-drilled passages in the crankshaft to lubricate the connecting rod bearings. Controlled leakage through the crankshaft main bearings and connecting rod bearings is slung radially outward
to cool and lubricate the cylinder walls as well as the entire connecting rod, piston and piston ring assembly.
