<p><b><i>NOTICE: 
</i> The engine cooling system is filled with Motorcraft® Specialty Orange Engine Coolant. Do not mix coolant types. Mixing coolant types degrades the corrosion protection of Motorcraft® Specialty Orange Engine Coolant. Failure to follow these instructions may damage the engine or cooling system.
</b></p><p><b>NOTE: 
</b> During normal vehicle operation, Motorcraft Specialty Orange Engine Coolant may change color from orange to pink or light red. As long as the engine coolant is clear and uncontaminated, this color change does not indicate the engine coolant has degraded nor does it require the engine coolant to be drained, the system to be flushed, or the engine coolant to be replaced.
</p><p>The cooling system components include the:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>radiator
</li><li>cooling fan motor and shroud
</li><li>degas bottle
</li><li>radiator drain valve
</li><li>coolant pump
</li><li>thermostat housing
</li><li>block heater (if equipped)
</li></ul><p>The engine uses a cold side thermostat. This means the thermostat is located at the lower radiator hose connection to the engine, where coolant enters the engine after being cooled by the radiator. During initial warm-up, the cooler coolant from the radiator quickly closes the thermostat after the warm coolant in the engine opens the thermostat slightly. The thermostat opens and closes several times before the coolant coming from the radiator is warm enough to allow the thermostat to remain open. The engine must run much longer than a vehicle with a hot side thermostat before the thermostat remains fully opened.
</p><p>Engine coolant provides freeze protection, boil protection, corrosion protection and cooling efficiency to the engine and cooling components. In order to obtain these protections, maintain the engine coolant at the correct concentration and fluid level in the degas bottle.
</p><p>When adding engine coolant, use a 50/50 mixture of engine coolant and distilled water. A coolant concentration of 50% will provide freeze point protection down to -37°C (-34°F).
</p><p>To maintain the integrity of the coolant and the cooling system:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>Add Motorcraft® Specialty Orange Engine Coolant or equivalent meeting Ford specification WSS-M97B44-D (orange color).
</li><li>Do not add or mix with any other engine coolant. Mixing coolants degrades the coolant corrosion protection.
</li><li>Do not add alcohol, methanol, brine or any engine coolants mixed with alcohol or methanol antifreeze. These can cause engine damage from overheating or freezing.
</li><li>Ford Motor Company does NOT recommend the use of recycled engine coolant in vehicles originally equipped with Motorcraft® Specialty Orange Engine Coolant since a Ford-approved recycling process is not yet available.
