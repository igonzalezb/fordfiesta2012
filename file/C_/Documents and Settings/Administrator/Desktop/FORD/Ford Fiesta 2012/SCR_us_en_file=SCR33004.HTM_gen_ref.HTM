Do not unscrew the coolant pressure relief cap when the engine is operating or the cooling system is hot. The cooling system is under pressure; steam and hot liquid can come out forcefully when the cap is loosened slightly. Failure to follow these instructions may result in serious personal injury.
</b></p><p><b><i>NOTICE: 
</i> The coolant must be recovered in a suitable, clean container for reuse. If the coolant is contaminated, it must be recycled or disposed of correctly. Using contaminated coolant may damage the engine or cooling system components.
</b></p><p><b>NOTE: 
</b> During normal vehicle operation, Motorcraft Specialty Orange Engine Coolant may change color from orange to pink or light red. As long as the engine coolant is clear and uncontaminated, this color change does not indicate the engine coolant has degraded nor does it require the engine coolant to be drained, the system to be flushed, or the engine coolant to be replaced.
</p>Release the pressure in the cooling system by slowly turning the pressure relief cap one half turn counterclockwise. When the pressure has been released, remove the pressure relief cap.
