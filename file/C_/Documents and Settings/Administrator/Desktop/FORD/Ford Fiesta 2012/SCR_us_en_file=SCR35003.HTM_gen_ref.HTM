<p><b>Drive Belt — Noise/Flutter
</b></p><p><b><i>NOTICE: 
</i> Under no circumstances should the accessory drive belt, tensioner or pulleys have any fluids or belt dressing applied to them as damage to the belt material and tensioner damping mechanism may occur.
</b></p><p>Drive belt chirp occurs due to pulley misalignment or excessive pulley runout. It can be the result of a damaged or incorrectly aligned grooved pulley.
</p><p>To correct, determine the area where the noise comes from. Check each of the pulleys in that area with a straightedge to the crankshaft pulley. Look for accessory pulleys out of position in the fore/aft direction or at an angle to
the straightedge.
</p><p>Drive belt squeal may be an intermittent or constant noise that occurs when the drive belt slips on an accessory pulley under certain conditions.
</p><p>A short intermittent squeal may occur during engine start up and shut down or during very rapid engine acceleration and decelerations, such as:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>Wide Open Throttle (WOT) 1-2 and 2-3 shifts or 2-3 and 3-4 back-out shifts on automatic transmissions.
</li><li><span title="Wide Open Throttle" class="popup" onmouseover="this.className='popupnounderline';" onmouseout="this.className='popup';">WOT
</span> 1-2 and 2-3 shifts and any combination of rapid downshifting on manual transmissions.
</li></ul><p>These special short-term transient events are expected, and are due to the higher system inertias required to meet the electrical and cooling demands on today's vehicle systems. Constant or reoccurring drive belt squeal can occur:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>if the A/C discharge pressure goes above specifications:

<ul type="square"><li>the A/C system is overcharged.
</li><li>the A/C condenser core airflow is blocked.
</li><li>the A/C anti-slugging strategy executes after a long hot heat soak.
</li></ul></li><li>if the A/C off equalized pressure (the common discharged and suction pressure that occurs after several minutes) exceeds specifications.
</li><li>if any of the accessories or idler pulley(s) are damaged or have a worn or damaged bearing. All accessories should be rotatable by hand in the unloaded condition. If not, inspect the accessory.
</li><li>if there is evidence of fluid contamination on the accessory drive belt. When the drive belt has been exposed to fluid contamination during vehicle operation, such as leaks from the power steering system, A/C system or cooling system, clean
all pulleys with soap and water, rinse with clean water and install a new accessory drive belt. If the drive belt has been exposed to fluids in a localized area during routine vehicle service, such as replacement of hoses or fluids, the drive belt
and pulleys should be washed with soap and water immediately (prior to starting the engine), and rinsed with clean water.
</li><li>Install a new accessory drive belt if the drive belt is worn or damaged.

<p><b>Drive Belt — Incorrect Installation
</b></p><p><b><i>NOTICE: 
</i> Incorrect accessory drive belt installation will cause excessive drive belt wear and may cause the drive belt to come off the pulleys.
</b></p><p>Non-standard accessory drive belts can track differently or incorrectly. If an accessory drive belt tracks incorrectly, install a new accessory drive belt to avoid performance failure or loss of the drive belt.

If the edge of the accessory drive belt rides beyond the edge of the pulleys, noise and premature wear will occur. Make sure the accessory drive belt rides
correctly on the pulley. If an accessory drive belt tracking condition exists, proceed with the following:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>Visually check the accessory drive belt tensioner for damage and wear, especially the mounting pad surface and arm alignment. If the accessory drive belt tensioner is not installed correctly, the mounting surface pad will be out of position.
If the tensioner arm is worn, the arm will be out of alignment. Either of these conditions will result in chirp and squeal noises.
</li><li>With the engine running, visually observe the grooves in the pulleys (not the pulley flanges or the pulley forward faces) for excessive wobble. Install new components as necessary.
</li><li>Check all accessories, mounting brackets and the accessory drive belt tensioner for any interference that would prevent the component from mounting correctly. Correct any interference condition and recheck the accessory drive belt tracking.
</li><li>Tighten all accessories, mounting brackets and accessory drive belt tensioner retaining hardware to specification. Recheck the accessory drive belt tracking.
