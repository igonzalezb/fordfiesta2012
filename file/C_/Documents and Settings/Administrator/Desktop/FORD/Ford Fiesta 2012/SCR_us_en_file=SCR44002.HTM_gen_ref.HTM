</li></ul>Combined load carrying capacity of replacement wheels for a given axle, must be equal to or greater than that axle's gross axle weight rating (GAWR) identified on the vehicle's Safety Compliance Certification label. All other specifications should be evaluated by measurement of both the original wheel and the replacement wheel. If specifications are not equivalent, the safety and handling of the vehicle may be degraded, which may result in serious injury to the vehicle occupant(s).

The recommended tire and wheel size may be found on either the Safety Compliance Certification Label or the Tire Label, which is located on the B-pillar or edge of the driver's door. If the information is not found on these labels, consult a Ford dealer. Use of any tire or wheel not recommended by Ford can affect the safety and performance of the vehicle, which could result in an increased risk of loss of vehicle control, vehicle rollover, personal injury and death. Additionally, the use of non-recommended tires and wheels could cause steering, suspension, axle or transfer case/power transfer unit failure.
</b></p><p><b><i>NOTICE: 
</i> Do not clean aluminum wheels with steel wool, abrasive-type cleaners or strong detergents or damage to the wheel finish may occur. Use Wheel and Tire Cleaner ZC-27-A or -B or equivalent.
</b></p><p>Factory-installed tires and wheels are designed to operate satisfactorily with loads up to and including full-rated load capacity when inflated to recommended inflation pressures.
</p><p>Correct tire pressure and driving techniques have an important influence on tire life. Heavy cornering, excessively rapid acceleration and unnecessary sharp braking increase tire wear.
</p><p>To equalize tire wear, rotate the tires at recommended intervals.
