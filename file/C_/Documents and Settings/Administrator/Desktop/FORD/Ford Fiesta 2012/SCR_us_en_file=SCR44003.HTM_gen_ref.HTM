<p><b>Tire Wear
</b></p><p>Tire wear is commonly defined as a loss of tread depth. Tire tread wear occurs due to friction with the contact surface (road/pavement). The tread should wear down uniformly all the way around the circumference of the tire and all the
way across the tread face. When this does not occur, the tire may have abnormal/incorrect wear.
</p><h5>Normal Tire Wear 
</h5><p>Normal tire wear is identified as even wear around and across the tread. Because there are many factors (driving style, road surfaces, type of vehicle, type of tire) that can affect tire wear, there is no absolute mileage expectation for
a normal wear condition. A tire is considered worn-out when the tread has worn to the level of the tread-wear indicators.
</p><h5>Abnormal/Incorrect Tire Wear 
</h5><p>Abnormal/incorrect tire wear is identified as tire wear that is not even around or across the tread and that creates performance-related issues.
</p><p>Abnormal/incorrect wear can be caused by numerous factors, some of which include driving style (aggressive, passive), climate (hot, cold), road conditions, vehicle loading and maintenance (correct tire pressure, rotation intervals and
balance). It is important to determine the root cause of wear on a vehicle before carrying out repair. Tires exhibiting abnormal/incorrect tire wear may still be serviceable provided that the minimum tread depth is greater than 2/32 inch and the
tire is not causing a vehicle performance (noise/vibration) concern.
</p><p>Some abnormal/incorrect wear patterns look the same all the way around the tread of the tire, other wear patterns are not consistent and can occur in various spots on the tread area. The underlying causes of the 6 wear categories are
different. Refer to the following descriptions to identify the type of wear and GO to 
<a href="SCR_us_en_file%3dSCR44003.HTM_gen_ref.HTM#SC1"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       >Symptom Chart - Tire Wear
</a> for the appropriate repair action to be carried out.
</p><h5>Inner Edge/Shoulder Wear 
</h5><p>Inner edge (or shoulder) wear occurs on the inside edge of the tire and is usually caused by excessive toe out and/or excessive negative camber. If the tread depth of the outer shoulder is at least 50% greater than the tread depth of the
inner shoulder, the tire is experiencing inner edge/shoulder wear. To determine whether tires have this type of wear, visually inspect the tires. In some instances, it may be necessary to measure the tread depth of each rib and compare it to that of
the shoulder.

</h5><p>Outer edge (or shoulder) wear occurs on the outside edge of the tire and is usually caused by excessive toe in and/or excessive positive camber. If the tread depth of the inner shoulder is at least 50% greater than the tread depth of the
outer shoulder, the tire is experiencing outer edge/shoulder wear. To determine whether tires have this type of wear, visually inspect the tires. In some instances, it may be necessary to measure the tread depth of each rib and compare it to that of
the shoulder.

</h5><p>Heel/toe wear (also known as feathering) occurs along the outside or inside edge/shoulder of the tire. To determine whether tires have this type of wear, visually inspect the tires in both the inside and outside shoulder ribs. In
some instances, it may be necessary to measure the difference in tread depth of leading versus trailing edge of each lug in the inside and outside shoulder rib.
</p><IMG src="SCR_us_en_file%3dN0046118.jpg_gen_ref.jpg"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        height="211" width="325" border="1"><h5>Diagonal Wear 
</h5><p>Diagonal wear occurs diagonally across the tread area and around the circumference of the tire. To determine whether tires have this type of wear, visually inspect the tires to determine if the wear pattern runs diagonally across the tread
and around the circumference of the tire. In some instances, the difference in tread depth along the diagonal wear pattern may need to be measured.

<p><b>Radial Runout
</b></p><p>Radial runout is the egg-shaped deviation from a perfect circle and is measured perpendicular to the circumference. On a wheel and tire assembly, this means measuring the center tire tread rib. The center rib is indicative of the condition
of the tire as a whole. Total runout is the difference between the maximum-to-minimum gauge reading. The high spot is the location of maximum runout.

<p><b>Loaded Runout Measurement (Hunter Road ForceÂ® 9700 Series Wheel Balancer)
</b></p><p><b>NOTE: 
</b> Diagnosis of tire/wheel vibration should not be performed on tires with less than 320 km (200 mi). Some initial tire/wheel vibration issues (such as flat spotting) may correct themselves after the tires have been in service for 320 km
(200 mi).
</p><p>This procedure is intended to assist with the diagnosis of wheel and tire assembly runout and/or force variation issues.
</p><p>The Hunter Road ForceÂ® 9700 Series Wheel Balancer measures the wheel and tire assembly's loaded runout and the tire's radial spring rate. The balancer then converts the runout into pounds of force (termed as Road
ForceÂ®). Measuring loaded runout (Road ForceÂ®) is more effective than measuring unloaded runout using a dial indicator.

<p><b>Wheel-to-Hub Optimization
