<p>The front halfshafts consist of the following:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>CV joints at both ends to make sure that the rotation is smooth
</li><li>Tripod CV joints (with tripod, running rollers and tripod housing) are fitted on the transmission side
</li><li>CV joints nearest the wheel are caged ball joints (with ball star, ball cage and ball shell)
</li><li>LH tripod joint is secured in the differential with a circlip
</li><li>Intermediate shaft (RH side) is secured in the differential by the intermediate shaft bearing
</li><li>Tripod housing of the tripod CV joint for the RH front halfshaft and the intermediate shaft are attached as a unique part
</li><li>Outboard CV joints are attached to the splined wheel hubs with nuts that control wheel bearing preload
</li></ul><p>The front halfshafts transmit torque generated by the engine from the transaxle to the wheels. In order to allow vertical and horizontal movement of the wheels, the front drive halfshafts operate at varying lengths and angles. The tripod
CV joints allow for changes in halfshaft length during axial movements. The caged balls of the outer CV joint permit the articulation of the front wheels and retain the stability of the intermediate and interconnecting shafts.
</p><p>Special care should be taken when removing and installing or assembling and disassembling front halfshafts. The inner tripod joint must not be bent at more than 18 degrees. Do not allow the boots to come into contact with sharp edges or the
hot exhaust system. Do not drop the front halfshaft as this can damage the inside of the boots without any signs of damage showing on the outside. Do not use front halfshafts as levering tools for the installation of other components. The
front halfshafts must always be supported when disconnected from the wheel ends.
