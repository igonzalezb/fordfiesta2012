<p>This DPS6 is a fully automatic, dry dual clutch, automatic shifting manual, electronically controlled 6-speed transaxle.
</p><p>Its abbreviated designation DPS6 means:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>D — Dry Dual Clutch
</li><li>P — Powershift
</li><li>S — Synchronized
</li><li>6 — 6-speed transaxle
</li></ul><p>This transaxle features the following:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>Computer Control with electro-mechanical actuation
</li><li>Two piece aluminum housing design
</li><li>Six (6) discrete stepped forward gears and one (1) reverse gear
</li><li>Dual Output shafts with two separate final drive ratios
</li><li>Full ball and roller bearing design for all gears and shafts
</li><li>All gears are bevel cut for improved NVH characteristics and power transfer
</li><li>All gears are in constant mesh for no loss of torque during the shifting process
</li><li>All cast construction of shift fork/linkage mechanisms
</li></ul><p>This transaxle features two nested input shafts driven by a compact dry dual clutch system. These two shafts are used in conjunction with each other to provide seamless shifting through the six (6) available ratios with overdrive in the two top gears. As each gear is selected, the appropriate clutch is activated to drive the vehicle. Each consecutive gear is then preselected for the next “shift” operation as power is shifted from one clutch to the other and back again as moving up and down through the individual gears
</p><p>This transaxle is designed to be operated in the same manner as a conventional torque converter equipped automatic transaxle. It provides the smooth application of power, but with the bonus of efficiencies found only in a manual transaxle. By delivering the power with a dual clutch system, fluid volume is limited to less than 2 liters as compared against a conventional automatic transaxle, and that is only within the gearbox case itself. The actuation of the clutch system is controlled by a dedicated computer through two individual electrically driven clutch motors and actuator systems.
</p><p>This transaxle provides six (6) discrete forward ratios with overdrive in the top two gears and a reverse gear, giving a continuous flow of power for acceleration and deceleration
</p><p>The selector lever gives the driver a choice of P, R, N, D and L.
</p><p>With the selector lever in the D position, you can operate the Transmission Control Switch (TCS)/Grade Assist switch on the selector lever to prevent the transaxle from shifting into 6th gear.
</p><p>If a fault occurs continued motoring is guaranteed in the following limited conditions based on the failure: 1st, 3rd and 5th gear if a fault with clutch 2 and/or relational components occurs. 2nd, 4th, 6th and reverse if a fault with clutch 1 and/or relational components occurs.
</p><p>This transaxle can be tested using a scan tool through the Data Link Connector (DLC) in the passenger compartment.
</p><ul type="disc"><b>Internal components are based on manual transaxle technologies that include: 
</b>

<li>Dry friction clutches to transmit power between the engine and transaxle
</li><li>Lay shaft gearing for high efficiency and uncoupled ratio selection
</li><li>Rotating sequential shift drums for fast response
</li><li>Synchronizers with dog clutches to pre-select and direct the power flow
</li><li>Splash fluid lubrication without filter and external oil coolers
</li></ul><ul type="disc"><b>This transaxle is two transaxles within one housing that share a common: 
</b>

<li>Final drive which includes two output shaft pinions
</li><li>Differential assembly
</li><li>Output Shaft Speed (OSS) sensor
</li><li>Transmission Range (TR) sensor
</li><li>Park system
</li><li>Transmission Control Module (TCM)
</li></ul><ul type="disc"><b>The first consists of three odd gear ratios (1st, 3rd & 5th):
