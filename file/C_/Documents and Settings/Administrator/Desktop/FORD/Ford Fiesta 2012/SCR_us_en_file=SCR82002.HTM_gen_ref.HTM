<p>The clutch control system is a hydraulic/mechanical clutch system. The clutch control system disengages the clutch when the clutch pedal is pressed and engages the clutch when the clutch pedal is released. When the clutch pedal is
pressed, pressure builds up in the clutch master cylinder and the release bearing in the clutch slave cylinder is actuated.
</p><p>The advantages of a hydraulic clutch system are:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>Automatic adjustment
</li><li>Low operating effort
</li><li>Minimal wear
</li></ul><p>A self-adjusting clutch system eliminates the need for maintenance adjustments. It provides for consistent pedal height throughout the service life of the clutch.
</p><p><b>Brake Fluid Reservoir
</b></p><p>The brake fluid reservoir supplies brake fluid to the hydraulic clutch system and the brake system. The hydraulic clutch system and brake system are arranged separately inside the brake fluid reservoir. If a leak occurs in the hydraulic
clutch system, the brake system continues to operate unrestricted.
</p><p><b>Brake Fluid Filling Reservoir
</b></p><p>The brake fluid filling reservoir is remotely attached to the brake fluid reservoir. Due to the brake fluid reservoirs location the brake fluid filling reservoir allows the technician to easily fill the brake fluid reservoir.
</p><p><b>Clutch Master Cylinder
</b></p><p>The clutch master cylinder generates the system pressure required to actuate the clutch. When the clutch pedal is depressed, the piston rod moves the clutch master cylinder piston. The hydraulic fluid in the clutch master cylinder is
forced through the high-pressure tube to the clutch slave cylinder.
</p><p><b>Clutch Pedal
</b></p><p>When the clutch pedal is pressed, the clutch master cylinder transmits hydraulic fluid pressure to the clutch slave cylinder. The clutch slave cylinder and the clutch release fork transfer the clutch pedal motion to the clutch release
bearing. The release bearing presses against the pressure plate diaphragm spring, releasing the clutch disc. Once the clutch pedal is released, the diaphragm spring pushes the piston in the clutch slave cylinder back to its initial position. The
non-positive connection between the clutch disc and the flywheel is re-established.
</p><p><b>Clutch Slave Cylinder
</b></p><p>The central clutch slave cylinder is equipped with a release bearing and is attached to the clutch bell housing with three bolts. The release bearing is an interference installed in the clutch slave cylinder and is not serviced separately.
</p><p>The hydraulic fluid forced from the piston in the clutch master cylinder moves the piston in the clutch slave cylinder which, moves the release bearing in an axial direction. The release bearing inner ring presses onto the diaphragm spring.
The non-positive connection between the clutch disc and the flywheel is interrupted.
