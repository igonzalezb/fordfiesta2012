For EMERGENCY MEDICAL INFORMATION seek medical advice. In the USA or Canada on Ford/Motorcraft products call: 1-800-959-3673. For additional information, consult the product Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) if available. Failure to follow these instructions may result in serious personal injury.
</b></p><p><b><i>NOTICE: 
</i> An Air Conditioning (A/C) refrigerant analyzer must be used before the recovery of any vehicle A/C refrigerant. Failure to do so puts the shop bulk refrigerant at risk of contamination. If the vehicle A/C refrigerant is contaminated, refer
the customer to the repair facility that carried out the last A/C repair. All contaminated A/C refrigerant must be disposed of as hazardous waste. For all equipment, follow the equipment manufacturer procedures and instructions.
</b></p><p><b><i>NOTICE: 
</i> The Thermostatic Expansion Valve (TXV) and hoses with mufflers, should be removed when flushing the Air Conditioning (A/C) system. Internal plumbing of these devices makes it impossible
to correctly remove any residual-flushing agent. These components are typically discarded after A/C system contamination. Hoses without mufflers can normally be reused unless they are clogged with foreign material.
</b></p><p><b>NOTE: 
</b> Prior to using the A/C Flush and Purge Machine 219-00022 for the first time, review the operating instructions.
</p><p><b>NOTE: 
</b> Only the A/C Flush and Purge Machine kit, which includes A/C Flush and Purge Machine, A/C Flush and Purge Fitting Kit and the A/C Systems Flushing Solvent, is approved for use. No other flushing device or solvent is approved for flushing
heat exchangers (A/C condenser, A/C evaporator). Use of any other flusher or solvent may cause damage to the A/C system and the flushing unit.
</p><p><b>NOTE: 
</b> Ford Motor Company has approved a procedure to provide technicians with a non-Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) method of flushing contaminated A/C system heat exchangers. The procedure allows
the specific components to be cleaned and flushed while installed in their normal in-vehicle location. The types of contamination flushed include particle matter that results from A/C compressor or desiccant failure and gummy residue that can form
when refrigerant oil is overheated during A/C compressor seizure. The flushing process is a 2-step procedure that involves the use of an A/C Flush and Purge Machine to:

<ul type="disc"><li>circulate the flushing solvent through the heat exchanger in the reverse direction of normal refrigerant flow (back-flushing). Particulate matter picked up during flushing is filtered from the returning solvent before the solvent is returned
to the reservoir for continued circulation.
</li><li>remove the flushing solvent from the heat exchanger. In this step of the procedure, pressurized air 621-862 kPa (90-125 psi) is used to push and evaporate any remaining flush solvent from the heat exchanger.
</li></ul></p>

<ol start="1"><li>Recover the refrigerant. For additional information, refer to 
<a href="SCR_us_en_file%3dSCRC0010.HTM_gen_ref.HTM"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       >Air Conditioning (A/C) System Recovery, Evacuation and Charging
</a> in this section.
</li></ol>

<ol start="2"><li>Disconnect the refrigerant lines from the heat exchanger(s) to be flushed.
</li></ol>

<ol start="3"><li>Connect the A/C Flush and Purge Machine to the heat exchanger to be flushed using the Refrigerant Flushing Equipment Connector or the correct adapters from the A/C Flush Adapter Kit. Do not flush through the evaporator core orifice or
hoses. The internal plumbing and material make-up of these components make it impossible to correctly remove foreign material or residual flushing solvent.
</li></ol>

<ol start="4"><li><p><b>NOTE: 
</b> Flush the heat exchanger for a minimum of 15 minutes. The flush solvent may be used for one or both heat exchangers in the A/C system. However, the flush solvent and the flushing unit filter is intended for one vehicle only.
</p>Flush the heat exchanger for a minimum of 15 minutes.
</li></ol>

<ol start="5"><li>Apply 621-862 kPa (90-125 psi) of pressurized air to the component for a minimum of 30 minutes. The 30-minute purge time is required to force and evaporate all residual solvent from the A/C system component. Failure to successfully remove
all residual solvent within the component can result in system damage when reconnected and operated. Dispose of the used flush solvent and filter in accordance with local, state and federal regulations.
</li></ol>

<ol start="6"><li><p><b>NOTE: 
</b> A/C system filtering as described in this section is optional if system flushing is carried out. However, the filter kit use is recommended after flushing if the A/C system contamination is extensive.
</p>Install a new Thermostatic Expansion Valve (TXV) in any vehicle being repaired for an internal A/C compressor or desiccant failure.

<ol start="7"><li>Install new refrigerant hoses if clogged with foreign material.
</li></ol>

<ol start="8"><li>Install a new receiver/drier in any vehicle being repaired for an internal A/C compressor or desiccant failure.
</li></ol>

<ol start="9"><li>Reconnect the heat exchanger being repaired.
