<p>The heating and ventilation system has the following features:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>Controls the temperature and, during A/C operation, reduces the relative humidity of the air inside the vehicle
</li><li>Delivers heated or cooled air to maintain the vehicle interior temperature and comfort level
</li><li>Cooling or heating can be adjusted to maintain the desired temperature
</li></ul><p>The heating and ventilation system includes the following components:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>Blower motor
</li><li>Heater core and evaporator core housing
</li><li>Heater core
</li></ul><div><a name="extract_484">&nbsp;
</a></div>

<p><b>Blower Motor
</b></p><p>The blower motor draws air from the air inlet and forces it into the heater core and evaporator core housing where it is mixed and distributed. The blower motor receives battery voltage at all times when the ignition is in the RUN position,
and is grounded by the HVAC module blower motor switch.
</p><p>The blower motor is mounted to the LH side of the heater core and evaporator core housing to the right of the pedal assembly.
</p><div><a name="extract_485">&nbsp;
</a></div>

<p><b>Heater Core and Evaporator Core Housing
</b></p><p>The heater core and evaporator core housing directs air flow from the blower motor through the evaporator core (if equipped) and heater core. All air flow from the blower motor passes through the evaporator core. The air flow is then directed
through or around the heater core by an electric motor actuated temperature blend door. After passing through or around the heater core, the air flow is distributed to the selected outlet. The air flow mode doors are actuated by a single
electric motor using a cam and gear setup.
</p><div><a name="extract_486">&nbsp;
</a></div>

<p><b>Heater Core
</b></p><p>The heater core receives a flow of coolant from the engine cooling system through the heater core inlet. The heater core consists of fins and tubes arranged to extract heat from the engine coolant and transfer it to air passing through
the heater core. The engine coolant is then returned to the engine cooling system through the heater core outlet.
</p><p>The heater core is located in the heater core and evaporator core housing.
