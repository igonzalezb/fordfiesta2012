</h4><meta name="tps_proctitle" content="Exterior Lighting">

<p>The exterior lighting system consists of the following components:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>Headlamp assemblies
</li><li>Body Control Module (BCM) (located under the glove compartment)
</li><li>Stoplamp switch
</li><li>Low beam relay
</li><li>High beam relay
</li><li>Reversing lamp relay
</li><li>Daytime Running Lamps (DRL) relay (if equipped)
</li><li>Headlamp switch
</li><li>Multifunction switch
</li><li>Reversing lamp switch (manual transaxle)
</li><li>Exterior mirror turn lamps
</li><li>High mounted stoplamp
</li><li>Rear lamp assemblies
</li><li>License plate lamps
</li></ul><p><b>Lamp Assembly Condensation
</b></p><p>Exterior lamps are vented to accommodate normal changes in pressure. Condensation can be a natural by-product of this design. When moist air enters the lamp assembly through the vents, there is a possibility that condensation can occur if the
temperature is cold. When normal condensation occurs, a thin mist forms on the interior of the lens. The thin mist eventually clears and exits through the vents during normal operation. The amount of time it takes to clear the lens of acceptable
mist varies with ambient humidity and lamp types. Normal condensation clears from any lamp in 48 hours under dry conditions.
</p><p>Do 
<b>not
</b> replace a lamp assembly with acceptable levels of condensation such as:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>presence of thin mist (no streaks, drip marks or droplets are present)
</li><li>fine mist covers less than 50% of the lens
</li></ul><p>Examples of unacceptable moisture (usually caused by a lamp housing leak):
</p><ul type="disc"><li>water puddling inside the lamp
</li><li>large water droplets, drip marks or streaks present on the interior of the lens
</li></ul><p><b>Headlamps
</b></p><p>The headlamp system is a quad-beam pattern system. It consists of replaceable low and high beam bulbs. The headlamp assembly has the park/turn indicator and side marker lamp integrated into the headlamp assembly. The headlamps do not
illuminate when the ignition is OFF or in ACC and the headlamp switch is in the HEADLAMPS ON position.
</p><p>If the headlamps are in the high beam mode when the headlamp switch is turned off, the 
<span title="Body Control Module" class="popup" onmouseover="this.className='popupnounderline';" onmouseout="this.className='popup';">BCM
</span> defaults the headlamps to the low beam mode the next time the headlamp switch
is placed in the HEADLAMPS ON position.
</p><p><b>Flash-to-Pass and High Beam
</b></p><p>When the ignition is in RUN, the high beams are illuminated when the multifunction switch is placed in the FLASH-TO-PASS position and remain illuminated until the multifunction switch is released.
</p><p>If the low beams are on when the multifunction switch is placed in the HIGH BEAM position, the high beams are illuminated in addition to the low beams (high beam mode). The high beams turn off (low beam mode) when the multifunction switch is
placed in the HIGH BEAM position again or the headlamp switch is switched out of the HEADLAMPS ON position.
</p><p><b>Headlamp Exit Delay
</b></p><p>When the ignition is OFF or in ACC and the multifunction switch is placed in the FLASH-TO-PASS position and released, the parking lamps and low beams are illuminated. They remain illuminated until one of the following occurs:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>3 minutes have elapsed with a door open
</li><li>30 seconds have elapsed after all doors are closed
</li><li>the multifunction switch is placed in the FLASH-TO-PASS position again
</li><li>the ignition changes to RUN
</li></ul><p>With all the doors closed, but within the 30 second delay, opening any door results in the 3 minute timer restarting.
</p><p><b>Daytime Running Lamps (DRL)
</b></p><p>If the vehicle is equipped with Daytime Running Lamps (DRL), the 
<span title="Body Control Module" class="popup" onmouseover="this.className='popupnounderline';" onmouseout="this.className='popup';">BCM
</span> is configured for this feature. The

<span title="Daytime Running Lamps" class="popup" onmouseover="this.className='popupnounderline';" onmouseout="this.className='popup';">DRL
</span> feature illuminates the low beam headlamps at a reduced intensity when the ignition is in RUN and the headlamp switch is in the OFF position.
</p><p>The 
<span title="Daytime Running Lamps" class="popup" onmouseover="this.className='popupnounderline';" onmouseout="this.className='popup';">DRL
</span> feature is inactive when the flash-to-pass feature is active.
</p><p>The 
<span title="Daytime Running Lamps" class="popup" onmouseover="this.className='popupnounderline';" onmouseout="this.className='popup';">DRL
</span> feature is not a programmable parameter for this vehicle.
</p><p><b>Stoplamps
</b></p><p>The stoplamp switch is located on the brake pedal assembly. The stoplamps illuminate when the brake pedal is applied. The rear lamps are combination stop/turn lamps on 4-door vehicles.
</p><p><b>Turn Signal/Hazard Lamps
</b></p><p>The front turn signal lamps are located within the headlamp assemblies. The rear lamps on 4-door vehicles share functionality with the stoplamps (combination stop/turn lamps). If equipped, there are turn signal lamps located within the exterior
mirrors.
</p><p>When the multifunction switch is place in the LH or RH LANE CHANGE position (first detent down or up) and released, the turn signals flash 1 or 3 times. This setting is programmed by the driver from the center display
(Front Control/Display Interface Module (FCDIM)) in the instrument panel.
</p><p>When the multifunction switch is placed in the LH or RH TURN position (second detent down or up), the 
<span title="Body Control Module" class="popup" onmouseover="this.className='popupnounderline';" onmouseout="this.className='popup';">BCM
</span> cycles the voltage on and off approximately 75 times per minute.
If a front or rear turn bulb is inoperative, the 
<span title="Body Control Module" class="popup" onmouseover="this.className='popupnounderline';" onmouseout="this.className='popup';">BCM
</span> cycles the voltage on and off approximately 150 times per minute.
</p><p>The hazard flasher switch is integrated into the Front Controls Interface Module (FCIM). When the hazard flasher switch is pressed, the

<span title="Body Control Module" class="popup" onmouseover="this.className='popupnounderline';" onmouseout="this.className='popup';">BCM
</span> cycles the voltage on and off to all the turn lamps approximately 75 times per minute.
</p><p><b>Parking Lamps
</b></p><p>The 
<span title="Body Control Module" class="popup" onmouseover="this.className='popupnounderline';" onmouseout="this.className='popup';">BCM
</span> supplies voltage to the parking lamps when demanded. The parking lamp system includes the following:
</p><ul type="disc"><li>Front parking lamps
</li><li>Front side marker lamps
</li><li>Rear parking lamps
</li><li>License plate lamps
</li></ul><p><b>Reversing Lamps
</b></p><p>When the transaxle is placed in REVERSE (R) with the ignition in RUN, the reversing lamp relay (automatic transaxle) or the reversing lamp switch (manual transaxle) provides voltage to the reversing lamps. The reversing lamps are located within
the rear lamp assemblies.
